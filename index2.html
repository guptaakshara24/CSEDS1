    <h1>What is global warming?</h1>
    <h2>
      Global warming is the phenomenon of a gradual increase in the temperature
      near the earth’s surface. This phenomenon has been observed over the past
      one or two centuries. This change has disturbed the climatic pattern of
      the earth. However, the concept of global warming is quite controversial
      but the scientists have provided relevant data in support of the fact that
      the temperature of the earth is rising constantly.

    <h2>Causes of Global Warming</h2>
  <h4>
    The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon. However, the increase in greenhouse gases is linked to human activities.
    It is thus no surprise that the world's leading climate scientists believe that human activities are very
    likely the main cause of global warming since the mid-twentieth century, mostly because of:</h4>
